<p>This article shows how to set up an SSH server so that users can authenticate :</p>

<ol>
  <li>either with a hardware token (FIDO-compatible actually)</li>
  <li>or with a two-factor authentication (2FA) process, using their password and a one-time password (OTP)</li>
  <li>from the intranet, with a standard SSH key</li>
</ol>

<p>In order to do that, we will see how to :</p>
<ul>
  <li>set up SSH for TOTP (with a PAM module)</li>
  <li>generate an OTP secret and “pair” with the user’s OTP application</li>
  <li>set up SSH for FIDO authentication</li>
  <li>set up the hardware token (I’m using a <a href="https://yubikey.me/">YubiKey</a> here)</li>
  <li>generate a FIDO key on the hardware token and “pair” with the server</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong><em>Note</em></strong></p>

  <p>This setup is only an example but should be a good starting point to build and tune your own authentication workflow.</p>

<h2 id="lets-start-with-otp-setup-">Let’s start with OTP setup !</h2>

<p><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/03/Security_token.jpg" alt="TOTP hardware token" class="inline" /></p>

<h3 id="server-host-setup">Server host setup</h3>

<p>In order for a “One-Time Password” (OTP) to be asked for after the usual password, we have to install a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_PAM">PAM module (Pluggable Authentication Module)</a> on the server side.
The module is <a href="https://github.com/google/google-authenticator-libpam">google-authenticator-libpam</a> : it’s from Google but it works with any TOTP-or-HOTP-compatible generator application.</p>

<p>Please note that this is not SSH-specific, the module will work for all authentications on this machine.</p>

<p>First install the module :</p>

<div class="language-shell highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nb">sudo </span>apt <span class="nb">install </span>libpam-google-authenticator
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>And enable it by editing PAM configuration ; here a sample <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/etc/pam.d/common-auth</code> file :</p>

<div class="language-shell highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="c"># 1. here are the per-package modules (the "Primary" block)</span>
<span class="c"># pam_unix is the standard password authentication</span>
<span class="c"># success=1 means to bypass one step (here pam_ldap.so) straight to the OTP module</span>
auth    <span class="o">[</span><span class="nv">success</span><span class="o">=</span>1 <span class="nv">default</span><span class="o">=</span>ignore]      pam_unix.so nullok_secure
<span class="c"># In this sample setup, we allow users to connect with their LDAP password</span>
<span class="c"># success=ok means to go to the next step (which is the OTP module)</span>
auth    <span class="o">[</span><span class="nv">success</span><span class="o">=</span>ok <span class="nv">default</span><span class="o">=</span>ignore]     pam_ldap.so <span class="nv">minimum_uid</span><span class="o">=</span>1000 use_first_pass
<span class="c"># Finally, the OTP password is asked</span>
<span class="c"># In case of success the 'deny' step is bypassed, leading to the 'permit' module</span>
auth    <span class="o">[</span><span class="nv">success</span><span class="o">=</span>1 <span class="nv">default</span><span class="o">=</span>ignore]      pam_google_authenticator.so

<span class="c"># 2. here's the fallback if no module succeeds</span>
auth    requisite                       pam_deny.so

<span class="c"># 3. prime the stack with a positive return value if there isn't one already;</span>
<span class="c"># this avoids us returning an error just because nothing sets a success code</span>
<span class="c"># since the modules above will each just jump around</span>
auth    required                        pam_permit.so
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><strong>From here, each user must generate a secret on the server in order to log in !</strong>
<strong>So, DO NOT LOG OUT now or generate an OTP secret for yourself (see below) and test the authentication before !</strong></p>

<p>There are other possible layouts for the PAM configuration, like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">nullok</code> to allow users to log in without OTP until they have set it up : <a href="https://github.com/google/google-authenticator-libpam">github.com/…/google-authenticator-libpam</a>.</p>

<p>For this PAM configuration to work with SSH you will have to enable the corresponding authentication method in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/etc/ssh/sshd_config</code> :</p>

<div class="language-shell highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="c"># Allows OTP authentication</span>
KbdInteractiveAuthentication <span class="nb">yes</span>
<span class="c">#ChallengeResponseAuthentication is a deprecated alias for KbdInteractiveAuthentication</span>
<span class="c">#ChallengeResponseAuthentication yes</span>

<span class="c"># Actually enables it</span>
AuthenticationMethods keyboard-interactive
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>And restart the SSH server :</p>

<div class="language-shell highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nb">sudo </span>sshd <span class="nt">-t</span> <span class="o">&amp;&amp;</span> <span class="nb">sudo </span>service ssh restart
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="per-user-setup">Per-user setup</h3>

<p>To connect using OTP, each user must have a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">~/.google_authenticator</code> file on the server, with the OTP secret and configuration.
Running the following console-interactive process on the server will create this file and print informations to import the secret into an OTP application (e.g. via a QRCode) :</p>

<div class="language-shell highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="c"># Runs a console-interactive process</span>
google-authenticator
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>You may need <a href="https://www.linode.com/docs/guides/secure-ssh-access-with-2fa/#generate-a-key">some help</a> to get the right answers.</p>

<p>Once generated, the secret file can be copied to other hosts in order to reuse the same OTP entry (of course you have to make sure users are not blocked by OTP until they can upload their secret) :</p>

<div class="language-shell highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="c"># Once done, send the file to other hosts where you want to use</span>
<span class="c"># the same OTP secret (e.g. same network servers)</span>
scp ~/.google_authenticator me@anotherhost.intranet
<span class="c"># This should not be necessary, but might help if the file was manually crafted</span>
ssh me@anotherhost.intranet <span class="s1">'chmod 0600 ~/.google_authenticator'</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Some good open source OTP apps for Android and iOS :</p>
<ul>
  <li><img src="https://getaegis.app/images/icon.png" alt="Aegis logo" class="inline" height="32px" /> <a href="https://getaegis.app/">Aegis</a></li>
  <li><img src="https://freeotp.github.io/img/freeotp.svg" alt="FreeOTP logo" class="inline" height="32px" /> <a href="https://freeotp.github.io/">FreeOTP</a></li>
</ul>

<p>A successful connection with OTP will look like this :</p>

<div class="language-shell highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nv">$ </span>ssh me@somehost.intranet
<span class="o">(</span>me@somehost.intranet<span class="o">)</span> Password:
<span class="o">(</span>me@somehost.intranet<span class="o">)</span> Verification code:
You have new mail.
me@somehost.intranet:~<span class="err">$</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="now-lets-add-authentication-with-a-hardware-token">Now let’s add authentication with a hardware token</h2>

<p>Since OpenSSH 8.2 it is possible to authenticate with a <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/fido2/">FIDO</a> device, which brings support for a whole lot of hardware tokens.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong><em>Note</em></strong></p>

  <p>Before 8.2, there were procedures like using a specific <a href="https://www.linode.com/docs/guides/how-to-use-yubikey-for-two-factor-ssh-authentication/">yubico-pam module for YubiKeys</a> (not described here).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The process is the same as with <em>public key</em> authentication but with a specific type of key, and you need your hardware token to be plugged in at authentication time.</p>

<h3 id="client-setup">Client setup</h3>

<h4 id="set-a-pin-on-the-fido2-token">Set a PIN on the FIDO2 token</h4>

<p>In order to use a <em>resident key</em> (see below) on a FIDO2 device, you will probably be required to set a PIN.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong><em>Note</em></strong></p>

  <p>Instructions in this paragraph are specific for YubiKey because it’s the one I had for my tests but the rest of the article should work seamlessly with any other FIDO2 devices (<a href="https://solokeys.com/">SoloKeys</a>, <a href="https://www.nitrokey.com/fr">Nitrokey</a>, <a href="https://onlykey.io/">OnlyKey</a>, … ) which may additionally bring interesting features like full open source design, reversible USB-A, firmware upgrades, hardware password manager, …</p>
</blockquote>

<p>For a YubiKey, you will need to <a href="https://support.yubico.com/hc/en-us/articles/360016649039-Enabling-the-Yubico-PPA-on-Ubuntu">install the <em>YubiKey Manager (ykman)</em></a>.
You will <em>not</em> need the <em>YubiKey Personalization Tool</em> for this tutorial, if you wonder.</p>

<p>If you’ve never set up a PIN on your YubiKey, simply run :</p>

<div class="language-shell highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="c"># Sample OS-independent installation command</span>
pip <span class="nb">install</span> <span class="nt">--user</span> yubikey-manager
<span class="c"># Set the PIN for the first time</span>
ykman fido access change-pin <span class="nt">--new-pin</span> tfbZxxGY3r
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>It’s important to note that the PIN is not limited to digits, FIDO2 allows up to <strong>63 alphanumeric characters</strong> !</p>

<h4 id="generate-an-ssh-key">Generate an SSH key</h4>

<p>Each user must then generate a compatible private key ; run this on a client workstation (choose between option a or b) :</p>

<div class="language-shell highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="c"># (option a) Generates a 'resident' key on the token so that it can be used on other computers</span>
<span class="c"># Replace 'NameYourKeyHere' with some string to identify this key</span>
<span class="c"># from others on the hardware token (e.g. 'intranet')</span>
ssh-keygen <span class="nt">-t</span> ed25519-sk <span class="nt">-O</span> resident <span class="nt">-O</span> <span class="nv">application</span><span class="o">=</span>ssh:NameYourKeyHere <span class="nt">-O</span> verify-required <span class="nt">-f</span> ~/.ssh/ed25519_sk_yubikey1

<span class="c"># OR (option b) Generates a key that will only be usable from this computer</span>
ssh-keygen <span class="nt">-t</span> ed25519-sk <span class="nt">-f</span> ~/.ssh/ed25519_sk_yubikey1

<span class="c"># Authorize it to the remote machines</span>
<span class="c"># I've observed that you may need to force with '-f' if you already have keys there</span>
ssh-copy-id <span class="nt">-i</span> ~/.ssh/ed25519_sk_yubikey1.pub me@somehost.intranet
ssh-copy-id <span class="nt">-i</span> ~/.ssh/ed25519_sk_yubikey1.pub me@anotherhost.intranet
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>You could use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">-t ecdsa-sk</code> key type instead. From what I understand, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ecdsa-sk</code> is more compatible ; <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ed25519-sk</code> is <a href="https://www.hyperelliptic.org/tanja/vortraege/20130531.pdf">not affiliated with NIST</a>.</p>

<p>The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">-O resident</code> parameter (<em>option a</em>) puts all key material on the hardware token, meaning that you will be able to use it from another computer (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ssh-keygen -K</code> will extract some <em>key handle</em> from the token into <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">~/.ssh/</code> on the local machine). In this case, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">-O verify-required</code> is also used so that a PIN is required.
<strong>This is only available for FIDO2 devices.</strong></p>

<p>On the contrary, the alternative (<em>option b</em>) command will require a private key to be present on the computer <em>in addition</em> to the hardware token, meaning that another person will not be able to log in from another computer even she finds/steals the hardware token.
<strong>This works with older FIDO devices.</strong></p>

<p>More explanations in the <a href="https://www.openssh.com/txt/release-8.2">release notes of OpenSSH</a>.</p>

<p>It is a good practice to repeat all those steps with another security token, so you are not locked-out in case you loose one, but you might also use the OTP process to recover.</p>

<h4 id="setting-up-the-ssh-client">Setting up the SSH client</h4>

<p>Finally, users should make sure that their SSH client configuration is ready to use their FIDO keys.
Here is a partial <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">~/.ssh/config</code> <em>(more infos in <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh_config">the man page</a>)</em> :</p>

<div class="language-shell highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="c"># Makes sure public key authentication is enabled</span>
PubkeyAuthentication <span class="nb">yes</span>
<span class="c"># In some weird configurations you might also want to check that</span>
<span class="c"># PreferredAuthentications includes publickey</span>

<span class="c"># Specify my keys for all hosts of the intranet (example)</span>
Host <span class="k">*</span>.intranet
  IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa
  IdentityFile ~/.ssh/ed25519_sk_yubikey1
  IdentityFile ~/.ssh/ed25519_sk_yubikey2
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Client is ready !</p>

<h3 id="ssh-server-setup">SSH server setup</h3>

<p>Now, the server part.</p>

<p>First make sure your server runs OpenSSH ≥ <a href="https://www.openssh.com/txt/release-8.2">8.2/8.2p1</a>.
With older Debian systems <a href="https://forums.raspberrypi.com/viewtopic.php?t=265211#p1817379">you can get it from backports</a>.</p>

<p>Then check <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/etc/ssh/sshd_config</code> (some parts are common with OTP above) <em>(more infos in <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sshd_config">the man page</a>)</em> :</p>

<div class="language-shell highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="c"># Public key authentication is used for keys on FIDO devices</span>
PubkeyAuthentication <span class="nb">yes</span>

<span class="c"># Actually enables it (we also keep keyboard-interactive for OTP)</span>
AuthenticationMethods publickey keyboard-interactive

<span class="c"># Makes sure to allow enough tries for users who have many keys</span>
<span class="c"># otherwise, they may encounter a 'Too many authentication failures' error</span>
<span class="c"># even before their FIDO key is tried...</span>
MaxAuthTries 9

<span class="c"># We also enable classic publickey authentication from the local network,</span>
<span class="c"># so connecting from there does not require a password nor a security token.</span>
<span class="c">#</span>
<span class="c"># Because 'PubkeyAuthentication' enables or disables both classic and FIDO keys</span>
<span class="c"># at the same time, we use 'PubkeyAcceptedKeyTypes' to limit key types to FIDO</span>
<span class="c"># by default. Because of the negative matches ('!'), this is applied only if</span>
<span class="c"># it does NOT match a local network address.</span>
<span class="c">#</span>
<span class="c"># Beware that this may not work as expected if connections to the SSH server</span>
<span class="c"># go through a (reverse) proxy or router which does not correctly relay the original client IP !</span>

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Match Address</code> block is to allow normal public key authentication <strong>from the local network only</strong> ; read the comments carefully.</p>

<p>Now restart the SSH server :</p>

<div class="language-shell highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nb">sudo </span>sshd <span class="nt">-t</span> <span class="o">&amp;&amp;</span> <span class="nb">sudo </span>service ssh restart
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><strong>From another session</strong>, try to authenticate :</p>

<div class="language-shell highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nv">$ </span>ssh somehost.intranet
<span class="c"># The following message may be different or even absent (your token might be flashing) !</span>
<span class="c"># See https://developers.yubico.com/SSH/Securing_SSH_with_FIDO2.html#_troubleshooting</span>

<span class="c"># Then, touch your FIDO2 token</span>

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>You’re in !</p>

<h2 id="bugs-and-limitations">Bugs and limitations</h2>

<h3 id="agent-refused-operation">Agent refused operation</h3>

<p>When your hardware token is not plugged in, you might have the following message :</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>sign_and_send_pubkey: signing failed for ED25519-SK "/home/me/.ssh/ed25519_sk_yubikey1" from agent: agent refused operation
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This is not blocking and SSH will use another method to authenticate (another ssh key or OTP).</p>

<h3 id="non-interactive-logins">Non-interactive logins</h3>

<p>OTP and FIDO2 “touch” method are suited for interactive login, but you might need to keep SSH public key authentication open for background services (e.g. mounting remote filesystems via SFTP).</p>

<p>In this case finer tuning is possible by targeting specific users in the SSH configuration.</p>

<p>After almost ten years of good and loyal services 🎖, I had to give up on my <a href="https://pcsupport.lenovo.com/us/en/products/laptops-and-netbooks/thinkpad-t-series-laptops/thinkpad-t520">Lenovo Thinkpad T520</a>, which was getting too slow for things like intensive Docker building…</p>

<p>Althought I still trust Lenovo for providing excellent Linux laptops, I wanted to try one of the newcomers in the Linux laptop market.</p>

<p>I made up my mind on <a href="https://www.tuxedocomputers.com/en/Linux-Hardware/Linux-Notebooks/15-16-inch/TUXEDO-InfinityBook-S-15-Gen6.tuxedo">InfinityBook S 15</a> from Tuxedo Computers (‘TC’).</p>

<h2 id="whats-in-the-box">What’s in the box</h2>

<ul>
  <li>The laptop itself (it’s just a customized <a href="https://clevo-computer.com/en/laptops-configurator/purpose/business-and-office-solutions/5400/clevo-ns50mu-intel-core-11-gen.-tiger-lake/iris-xe-graphics-thunderbolt-4">Clevo NS50</a>)</li>
  <li>A power cable (~ 2,80m from plug to computer)</li>
  <li>A quickstart manual</li>
  <li>A more complete manual (in german 🇩🇪, but helped me finding out the key to enter BIOS menu)</li>
  <li>An USB key with TC’s Web fully automated installation (“WebFAI”) - <em>not tested</em></li>
  <li>Some goodies : mouse pad, 2 pens, …</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="tuxedo-customer-service--shipping-documentation-">Tuxedo customer service : shipping, documentation,. ..</h2>

<ul>
  <li>At the difference of many comments I’ve seen around, my computer was shipped within a few days (around a week) - very statisfying</li>
  <li><a href="https://tuxedocomputers.com">Their website</a> is annoying as it does not let you CTRL-click a link to open into a new tab : the current page will freeze (click event is probably registered in javascript in a wrong way :-()</li>
  <li>At the time of writing, there is no dedicated help page for my device (<a href="https://www.tuxedocomputers.com/en/Infos/Help-Support/Help-for-my-device/TUXEDO-InfinityBook-Series.tuxedo">only for InfinityBook S14, not S15</a>)</li>
  <li>One mandatory thing for me is to be able to tune memory, disks, CPU before ordering. Tuxedo’s website is very good at this. You can even <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wrwNaS5dw4&amp;t=38">make your own keyboard</a> or <a href="https://www.tuxedocomputers.com/en/Individual-Keyboards.tuxedo">engrave a custom logo on the chassis</a>.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="performance--fan-noise">Performance &amp; fan noise</h2>

<p>I’m not a performance addict (I don’t play games, I don’t mine bitcoins, I don’t run do machine learning on my computer), so I have not run extended benchmarks.</p>

<p>However it’s obviously fast, it compiles docker images &amp; runs multiple VM seamlessly ; as expected regarding the <a href="https://linux-hardware.org/?probe=aabe23e7a8">Intel Tiger Lake Core i7 CPU, 64GB 3200MHz RAM and NVMe PCIe 4.0 disk</a>.</p>

<p>As seen in many comments, I can confirm that Tuxedo computers have an unusual management of fan speed.
The fan is agressively activated whenever there is a CPU / GPU utilization increase.
This follows a sane logic but can make you nervous when it suddenly starts to blow as the computer goes to sleep or when you’re in the train, in the middle of quiet people…</p>

<p>Even with the most quiet profile (‘silent’, in the <em>Tuxedo control center</em>) it will be triggered very early.</p>

<h2 id="display">Display</h2>

<ul>
  <li>I was worried looking at the poor display specifications but they don’t hold true : resolution and brightness are really fine. You will still have to forget about dark themes if you want to code under the sun but as far as I know it’s the case with most laptops out there.</li>
  <li>16/9 allows for a 15”6 display, and even if it’s not the best ratio for coding, the resolution compensates by allowing enough text rows to be displayed within the given height. I don’t regret this 15”6 over the 14” version as it brings some comfort displaying documents side by side.</li>
  <li>When working in stand up position, if your workbench is a bit low (e.g. 90 cm high), the lid does not open enough to get a comfortable 90° to the eyes. I would have appreciated it to open 15-20° more.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="sound">Sound</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Speakers are the worst I’ve ever encountered, without a doubt. Still, it proved enough for video conferencing (tested with <em>MS Teams</em>).</li>
  <li>The problem is only with internal speakers, not the sound card, as sound quality is good if you use an external headset.</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/tuxedocomputers/pulseeffects-presets">A suggested trick is to install PulseEffects</a> but it does not add any significant improvement with the given settings.</li>
  <li>Allowing volume over 100% is probably your best bet to get the most of it : <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">dconf write /com/solus-project/budgie-raven/allow-volume-overdrive true</code></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="camera">Camera</h2>

<ul>
  <li>The camera is also one of the poorest I’ve seen in years, it just seems to come from the past. Fortunately it’s not something I personally care about.</li>
  <li>There is an infrared camera that can be used with <em>Windows Hello</em>, but that is not taken into account out of the box by <a href="https://github.com/boltgolt/howdy"><em>Howdy</em>, the Linux alternative</a>. Howdy works with the normal camera, though, although the configuration is not obvious at first.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="keyboard-">Keyboard 🐧</h2>

<p>I have to say that the keyboard, ironically, turned out to be a major selling point for me, as most other Linux laptops distributors don’t support AZERTY layouts.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Numeric keypad (it’s been a long time I haven’t used one) : it’s nice to have it but, in the end, I can live without it and I would prefer to have it removed and the room used to get larger keys on the right side (shift, enter, …) and/or the speakers enhanced</li>
  <li>Black keys on black background is beautiful but not the best choice for the eyes : keys are faster to locate with silver/black combination for instance</li>
  <li>By default, there is a ‘Tux’ key 🐧 instead of a ‘Windows ‘ or ‘Apple’ one, which is funny, but <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nidnvlt6lzw&amp;t=1">you could also have whatever symbols printed on all keys</a>. This may help reduce the learning curve but it seems impossible to get what the default keyboard would look like anyway.</li>
  <li>Back-lit keyboard is also not the best technique to light keys. From my experience I find it more comfortable to light the keys from above (<a href="https://youtu.be/MH7o3Zb8HVg">ThinkPad™ had a ThinkLight™ embedded at the top of the lid</a>) : it enlightens all keys, their surface AND the touchpad (which is not, on the tux, making it tricky to find it or its fingerprint reader in the dark).</li>
  <li>As seen in a few forums, I confirm that the keys lights comes both from around (their side) and from the characters, which are semi-transparent</li>
  <li>This model can only have on color at a time (I couldn’t find a place where it’s stated). To change the color follow the procedure on TC’s website and reboot (it takes a kernel module to reload ; the doc is really hard to find (it’s <a href="https://www.tuxedocomputers.com/en/Infos/Help-Support/Instructions/Installation-of-keyboard-drivers-for-TUXEDO-Computers-models-with-RGB-keyboard-.tuxedo">here</a> and <a href="https://github.com/tuxedocomputers/tuxedo-keyboard">there</a>)). I’ve tried several values for the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">mode=</code> parameter but it didn’t change anything ; however changing the mode with the keyboard shortcut seems to cycle through preconfigured colors</li>
  <li>A visual <em>Num Lock</em> indicator would have been nice</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="touchpad">Touchpad</h2>

<ul>
  <li>The touchpad is not good.</li>
  <li>The slide sensation is not at the level I’m used to with Thinkpad and HP computers, resulting in a lower accuracy. It can be especially annoying when you need to do very small moves to put the cursor at a pixel-sized location. Maybe it can be fixed by configuration ?</li>
  <li>It looks less durable than a HP Elitebook or Envy laptop for instance. Let’s see in a few years if it looks like the one of my old Thinkpad <img src="TODO" alt="Photo" /></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="chassis">Chassis</h2>

<ul>
  <li>The chassis feels more heavy than I expected (compared to my old thinkpad <em>=&gt; have to check the weight</em>)</li>
  <li>It’s same width as a usual 15”6 but as short in depth as a 14”, which is great for transportation</li>
  <li>When opening the lid, lift-up hinges raise the notebook a little bit from the rear, which is ergonomic for typing, but in turn prevent to fit over a docking station like their own <a href="https://www.tuxedocomputers.com/en/Linux-Hardware/Accessories-books-co-/USB-accessories/Universal-docking-station-for-all-TUXEDO-Books-Type-C-Type-A-USB-connection_1.tuxedo">Tuxedo Office Hub</a>… I’ve tried several positions but it doesn’t easily stay in place.</li>
  <li>The lid (as well as most other parts) seem to be easily scratched and the material does not prevent finger marks at all (see photos below)</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="/assets/blog/screenshots/tuxedo-infinity/tuxinfinity_scratch.jpg" alt="Tuxedo InfinityBook scratched" />
<img src="/assets/blog/screenshots/tuxedo-infinity/tuxinfinity_fingermarks.jpg" alt="Tuxedo InfinityBook finger marks" /></p>

<h2 id="battery--charge">Battery &amp; charge</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Don’t trust the battery life advertized on TC’s website. It’s just a normal battery with normal life expectations. No more, no less.</li>
  <li>The cable is long enough and the charger fairly small enough for transportation.</li>
  <li>Charging with TC’s USB-C cable is as much efficient as with a classic cable. The USB-C port’s position seems a bit uncomfortable (in the middle - so it may be in the way sometimes, and not easy to plug without looking) but it has not annoyed me so far.</li>
  <li>Both cables feel the same weight and size overall, but the USB-C may allows you to charge your smartphone or another computer with a compatible battery.</li>
  <li>The <a href="https://www.tuxedocomputers.com/en/Infos/Help-Support/Frequently-asked-questions/What-is-Flexicharger-.tuxedo"><em>FlexiCharger</em></a> feature of Tuxedo is nice : it lets you preserve battery life (not autonomy) by preventing micro-charges. However when you need full capacity you have to reboot in order to deactivate it from the BIOS. This setting should be available from the OS (e.g. Tuxedo Control center) to really be called “flexible”.</li>
  <li>FlexiCharger has bugs, too : the BIOS UI enters an infinite loop if you try to set up the ‘stop charge’ threshold below the ‘start charge’ one, and sometimes the charge does not start when the battery capacity reaches the configured threshold : you have to unplug the cable and plug it back.</li>
  <li><em>Hibernate</em> menu does not work (I suspect it may be linked to the fact that I have 64 GB of RAM and no dedicated swap partition, but I haven’t investigated on this topic yet). Anyway hibernation has never worked out of the box with Ubuntu.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="fingerprint-reader">Fingerprint reader</h2>

<p>It’s there but not working :</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://linux-hardware.org/?id=usb:04f3-0c63">linuxhardware probe says there’s no known driver</a></li>
  <li>however seems to be supported with <a href="https://fprint.freedesktop.org/supported-devices.html"><em>f</em>print</a></li>
</ul>

<p>This does not make sense as it’s embedded on the touchpad’s surface so we would expect it to be useable… Maybe Tuxedo is hopping for a driver update ?</p>

<h2 id="tuxedos-webfai">Tuxedo’s WebFAI</h2>

<ul>
  <li>I wanted to use the provided USB key to test several distributions, but it’s a pain because this so-called WebFAI requires a <em>wired</em> connection, forcing me to stay next to the Internet box (which is not in a cosy place) during the whole installation.</li>
  <li>Otherwise, the USB key works (<a href="https://youtu.be/1TFMxbNtXyQ">Dominik said his was not</a>)</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="tuxedo-os--other-customizations">Tuxedo OS &amp; other customizations</h2>

<p>I ordered the computer pre-installed with <em>Tuxedo OS</em>, a custom <em>Ubuntu Budgie</em> distribution: there are a few things that don’t work out of the box with this configuration.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Some basic packages are missing (because of Ubuntu ?) ; e.g. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ifconfig</code></li>
  <li>Some presets that could be provided : installed PulseEffects, disabling Intel ME, FlexiCharger enabled ?</li>
  <li>Tuxedo Control Center has only a limited set of features, from which only the power profile is of some interest. From the reviews I read, I expected more. Also the tray icon is the only one in color…</li>
  <li>The computer seems to suspend to RAM when the lid is closed, as expected, but stills consumes a lot of energy : from 61% battery remaining to only 9% in appromixately 9h. Applying <a href="https://www.tuxedocomputers.com/en/Infos/Help-Support/Instructions/Fine-tuning-of-power-management-with-suspend-standby.tuxedo">this</a> enhances battery life (from 31% to 21% in 7h30). There may be even better solutions.</li>
  <li>Automatic or manual screen lock (<em>&lt;Super&gt;+L</em>) does not work OOTB, you have to enable it : <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">dconf write /org/gnome/desktop/lockdown/disable-lock-screen false</code></li>
  <li>When you ask for Tuxedo OS to be installed, in addition to the main partition, they also create the UEFI partition (512 MB FAT) and a swap partition at the end of the disk. But they made the swap partition 8 GB, whereas I have 64 GB of RAM…</li>
  <li>Software center is used (comes from Ubuntu), but it’s just not useable (anybody uses it anyway ?). You get multiple identical entries with no clue about which one to choose. Most of the time the version is outdated. etc.</li>
  <li>Some ‘autostart’ symlinks target missing executables (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/usr/local/bin/vboxinstall.sh</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/usr/local/bin/cryptshutdown.sh</code>)</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="tuxedos-bios">Tuxedo’s BIOS</h2>

<p>Tuxedo ships computers with a custom BIOS.</p>

<p>I thought that was fine, because they could provide nice features like FlexiCharger, <strong>disabling Intel ME</strong> (which was a major point for me), …
However I later learned that they get BIOS updates from <em>Clevo</em> for which <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/tuxedocomputers/comments/qbal7m/new_infinitybook_s15_bios/hhbvdgs/">they are not able to testify what’s inside</a>, which of course <strong>is a major issue for privacy !</strong></p>

<p>Unfortunately, this discredits all their work on the BIOS, and the best thing to do would probably be to <a href="https://www.tuxedocomputers.com/en/Infos/Help-Support/Frequently-asked-questions/Coreboot-on-TUXEDO-Computers-devices.tuxedo">switch to coreboot or alike instead</a>.</p>

<h2 id="wrapping-up">Wrapping up</h2>

<ul>
  <li><strong>I’m not impressed</strong>.</li>
  <li>I would rather <strong>trade the extended keys (numeric keypad and so) with better audio and larger ENTER and SHIFT keys</strong>.</li>
  <li>The <strong>touchpad is not good</strong>.</li>
  <li>The <strong>custom BIOS should be replaced with a more free-as-in-freedom one</strong>, just like <a href="https://www.coreboot.org/">coreboot</a>.</li>
  <li>The default Ubuntu Budgie install is not for <em>power users</em>. Change it.</li>
  <li>Still, <strong>it is an up-to-date computer for programmers</strong> and overall I don’t regret buying it as it’s ok for my daily usage.</li>
</ul>

Most of the time the version is outdated. etc. Some ‘autostart’ symlinks target missing executables (/usr/local/bin/vboxinstall.sh, /usr/local/bin/cryptshutdown.sh) Tuxedo’s BIOS Tuxedo ships computers with a custom BIOS. I thought that was fine, because they could provide nice features like FlexiCharger, disabling Intel ME (which was a major point for me), … However I later learned that they get BIOS updates from Clevo for which they are not able to testify what’s inside, which of course is a major issue for privacy ! Unfortunately, this discredits all their work on the BIOS, and the best thing to do would probably be to switch to coreboot or alike instead. Wrapping up I’m not impressed. I would rather trade the extended keys (numeric keypad and so) with better audio and larger ENTER and SHIFT keys. The touchpad is not good. The custom BIOS should be replaced with a more free-as-in-freedom one, just like coreboot. The default Ubuntu Budgie install is not for power users. Change it. Still, it is an up-to-date computer for programmers and overall I don’t regret buying it as it’s ok for my daily usage.

<h2 id="how-bluetooth-pairing-works">How Bluetooth pairing works</h2>

<p>Bluetooth is quite a complex thing. Really. I haven’t realized before I started this mini project. Beside its original goal to be a wireless replacement for cables, Bluetooth actually includes <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bluetooth#List_of_applications">a myriad of features</a>.
In order to understand how we should connect to our Raspberry Pi (<em>RPi</em>), let’s focus on some core aspects of Bluetooth.</p>

<h3 id="bluetooth-security-models">Bluetooth security models</h3>

<p>Being tightly coupled with hardware, Bluetooth has evolved a lot since its beginnings, following industry’s technical enhancements over the years.
This is why it has so many <em>security models</em> ; let’s try to understand how they compare.</p>

<h4 id="there-are-two-distinct-families-of-bluetooth">There are two distinct “families” of Bluetooth.</h4>

<p>The legacy, <strong>Basic Rate (BR)</strong> was the first and only protocol in the beginning. It was quickly complemented with <em>EDR (Enhanced Data Rate)</em> in Bluetooth 2.0, hence the name <strong>BR/EDR</strong>.</p>

<p>Bluetooth 4.0 came with another, not backward-compatible protocol  : <strong>Bluetooth Low Energy (abbreviated LE, or BLE)</strong>. This new Bluetooth “family” requires less energy and fits smartphones and <em>IoT</em> better.</p>

<p>Althought <em>BR/EDR</em> and <em>BLE</em> are not compatible, Bluetooth devices can implement one or the other, or even both. For the record there is also an <em>AMP</em> specification, usually implemented in a secondary controller, in order to achieve Wi-Fi class transfer rates.</p>

<p>Each protocol “family” has their own security and association models, even though they follow the same logic :</p>

<p><img class="plantuml" id="066cc5d2b2fa5d69148f35ff812fb260" alt="PlantUML diagram" src="/assets/uml/066cc5d2b2fa5d69148f35ff812fb260.svg" /></p>

<h4 id="which-security-level-to-choose-">Which security level to choose ?</h4>

<p>The Bluetooth Core Specification<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> makes it clear that :</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Secure Connections Only Mode is sometimes called a “FIPS Mode”.
This mode should be used when it is more important for a device to have high security than it is for it to maintain backwards compatibility with devices that do not support Secure Connections.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>My feeling reading the specifications is that Bluetooth was not made with high expectations on security from the beginning. It has so many trade-offs at the benefit of usability that <em>Secure Connections</em>, whether for BR/EDR or LE, just looks to me like the bare minimum to have.</p>

<p><em>BR/EDR Legacy Pairing</em>’s security for instance <em>unavoidably depends</em> on the length of the PIN (which is often a small four-digit number, or even a fixed value) and provide little-to-none protection against eavesdropping or man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks.
<em>Secure Simple Pairing</em> for its part only <em>“protects the user from MITM attacks with a goal of offering a 1 in 1,000,000 chance that a MITM could mount a successful attack<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>“</em>. It strongly depends on human decisions (based on failure alerts in case of an attack) to mitigate the risk and allows for configurations that <em>would</em> make it unsecure.
Without going on with further examples, it’s easy to configure it wrong and let the neighbors accidentally connect to your Bluetooth device or any passing-by hacker to gather any personal information.</p>

<p>Also, “LE is the new BR/EDR”. Most efforts seem to be put on Bluetooth LE and Bluetooh BR/EDR suffers from not being up-to-date with today’s requirements. For instance : in BR/EDR, cryptographic key generation is being made in lower, often hardware, layers, making it difficult to upgrade security algorithms.
This is probably the fate of a very pragmatic specification that didn’t intend to foresee the future of technology ; unfortunately this leaves us with a plethora of unsecure devices in the wild.</p>

<p>Wrapping up, this gives the “LE Secure Connections” mode my preference and I will try to make it rule my configuration.</p>

<h3 id="bluetooth-association-models">Bluetooth association models</h3>

<p>The above diagram states that there are several <em>association models</em> ; here are the four ones that apply to <em>Bluetooth Low Energy</em> :</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Numeric Comparison</strong> (only since Bluetooth 4.2 for BLE)</li>
  <li><strong>Just Works</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Passkey entry</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Out-of-Band (OOB)</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>For the sake of completeness we will also talk about :</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>BR/EDR Legacy pairing</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>Let’s see how they work, and how well they would fit our use case.</p>

<h4 id="numeric-comparison">Numeric comparison</h4>

<p>The Bluetooth Core Specification<sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote" rel="footnote">3</a></sup> has a very neat way to describe the <em>Numeric Comparison</em> model :</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The user is shown a six digit number (from “000000” to “999999”) on both
displays and then asked whether the numbers are the same on both devices. If
“yes” is entered on both devices, the pairing is successful.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It is important to understand that <em>this number is not chosen</em> by any party : it is randomly computed on each connection attempt, as part of the pairing algorithm<sup id="fnref:4" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote" rel="footnote">4</a></sup>. <em>It is not a passcode</em> either : it just helps users check that they pair to the expected device by showing the same value on both sides. If a malicious user were trying to penetrate our home he would just have to hit “Yes” on its side, whatever the value of this 6-digit number.</p>

<p>The <em>Numeric Comparison</em> protocol also allows devices to skip this user confirmation<sup id="fnref:4:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote" rel="footnote">4</a></sup> to automatically pair, but in order to preserve control over who can connect, we should not make this possible and enforce a confirmation on the RPi side.</p>

<h4 id="just-works">Just works</h4>

<p>The <em>Just Works</em> model is a specific case of <em>Numeric Comparison</em> designed for the case where at least one device in the pair has no human interface at all.
Therefore, it does not enforce any confirmation whatsoever.</p>

<p>Here is an excerpt from the specifications<sup id="fnref:3:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote" rel="footnote">3</a></sup> :</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The Just Works association model uses the Numeric Comparison protocol but
the user is never shown a number and the application may simply ask the user
to accept the connection (exact implementation is up to the end product
manufacturer).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As for <em>Numeric Comparison</em>, it looks like a good candidate for our use case, provided that we add a confirmation step as allowed.</p>

<h4 id="passkey-entry">Passkey Entry</h4>

<p><em>Passkey Entry</em> is used when one of the devices has input capabilities but no display (e.g. a keyboard).</p>

<p>A six-digit number is displayed on the device that can display and must be entered on the other one for the pairing to be successful.</p>

<p>At the difference of <em>Numeric Comparison</em>, this number is not only here to check that the devices are the ones we intend to pair, but it also serves as an input data <em>required</em> to authenticate and validate the association<sup id="fnref:4:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote" rel="footnote">4</a></sup> <sup id="fnref:5" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote" rel="footnote">5</a></sup>.</p>

<p>In contrast with <em>Numeric Comparison</em>, this model does not allow automatic connection because each side has to prove they know the <em>passkey</em> :</p>

<ul>
  <li>the <em>display device</em> is the only one to know the number in the beginning ; it decides the way the <em>passkey</em> is revealed to the other one</li>
  <li>the <em>input-only device</em> must enter the (supposedly secret) <em>passkey</em></li>
</ul>

<p>With some tweaks, a headless Raspberry Pi might be on one side or the other :</p>

<ul>
  <li>if it were the <em>display device</em>, we should replace the display step with an equivalent, headless mechanism that allows the other user to obtain the number</li>
  <li>if it were the <em>input-only device</em>, we should find a way to get the number displayed on the other device entered into the RPi</li>
</ul>

<p>This may not look trivial ; we’ll see what can be done later on…</p>

<h4 id="out-of-band-oob">Out of Band (OOB)</h4>

<p>With <a href="https://www.bluetooth.com/blog/bluetooth-pairing-part-5-legacy-pairing-out-of-band/">Out of Band</a>, the devices first discover (and optionally authenticate) themselves with a different mechanism than Bluetooth. It can be any protocol, like NFC or Wi-Fi for instance.</p>

<p>This fits well when both devices are known to share a common mechanism and are explicitly set up to work in this way. For instance a camera and its manufacturer’s mobile application will both be programmed to connect with NFC first, then share their “services” through Bluetooth.</p>

<p>But this seemingly won’t work for us, as we want to allow common smartphones - with only standard applications - to connect.
Furthermore, adding another mechanism than Bluetooth as a requirement looks superfluous…</p>

<h4 id="bredr-models">BR/EDR models</h4>

<p>The four previous models also apply to the BR/EDR side but with some subtle differences in their implementation, which we will not cover…</p>

<p>Finally, there is one more model that apply only to the BR/EDR family : <strong>BR/EDR Legacy pairing</strong>, which was the only association model before Bluetooth 2.1 (see the diagram above).</p>

<p>It requires the two devices to enter the same, 16-character maximum, secret PIN code.</p>

<p>Although it looks similar to <em>Passkey Entry</em>, it is far less secure because, here, the connection’s encryption directly depends on the complexity of the PIN code.</p>

<p>What sounds like a practical idea that could be easily implemented on headless devices by simply setting up a static PIN code, unfortunately reveals to be largely unsecure, because the underlying cryptography is not strong enough to compensate weak/short/static/numeric only PIN codes that can be seen on many devices in the wild…</p>

<p>It is therefore not considered a potential solution in this article.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>TODO Compare the security of a four-digit vs a really long PIN code in this model vs in other models</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="choosing-the-right-association-model">Choosing the right association model</h3>

<p>I’ve chosen the three following factors to compare BLE association models regarding my use case :</p>

<ol>
  <li>Should not require complex user interaction on the Raspberry Pi’s side (e.g. no SSH login to type a passkey)</li>
  <li>Must be able to control who can connect to the Raspberry Pi (i.e. only known device or manually approved ones)</li>
  <li>Secure enough (as much as Bluetooth can)</li>
</ol>

<p>Let’s summarize what we’ve asserted in the previous chapter :</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th> </th>
      <th>Numeric comparison*</th>
      <th>Just Works</th>
      <th>Passkey Entry</th>

</table>

<p><em>* without automatic pairing</em>
<em>** even more than others<sup id="fnref:6" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote" rel="footnote">6</a></sup></em></p>

<p>This table shows, in a way, that authorization in Bluetooth expects either no approval or a manual one, which makes it hard to get good security with headless devices…</p>

<p>As discussed before, <em>Out of Band</em> is eliminated because it requires another protocol and <em>BR/EDR Legacy Pairing</em> is irrelevant for security reasons.</p>

<p>In order to get all three requirements met we therefore may use :</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Just Works</strong> with additional authorization</li>
  <li><strong>Numeric Comparison</strong> with a headless validation step</li>
  <li><strong>Passkey Entry</strong> with a headless mechanism to display and validate a 6-digit number</li>
</ul>

<p>Unfortunately, except for <em>BR/EDR Legacy Pairing</em> <strong>one cannot <em>choose</em> the association model : it is asserted from the devices’ capabilities</strong>, called <a href="https://www.bluetooth.com/blog/bluetooth-pairing-part-1-pairing-feature-exchange/"><em>Input and Output capabilities (IO capabilities)</em></a><sup id="fnref:7" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote" rel="footnote">7</a></sup>.</p>

<p>In order to make sure only approved workflows can be selected, our RPi device must therefore advertise only the matching IO capabilites.</p>

<p>How ? There are full-blown tables<sup id="fnref:3:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote" rel="footnote">3</a></sup> describing the available IO capabilities and the mapping to the matching association models.</p>

<p>The <strong>input capabilites</strong> are :</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>No input</strong> : Device does not have the ability to indicate ‘yes’ or ‘no’</li>
  <li><strong>Yes / No</strong> : Device provides the user a way to indicate either ‘yes’ or ‘no’</li>
  <li><strong>Keyboard</strong> : Device allows the user to input numbers <em>and</em> to indicate ‘yes’ or ‘no’</li>
</ul>

<p>And the <strong>output capabilities</strong> are :</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>No output</strong> : Device does not have the ability to display or communicate a
6 digit decimal number</li>
  <li><strong>Numeric output</strong> : Device has the ability to display or communicate a 6 digit decimal number</li>
</ul>

<p>Here is an overview of the <strong>IO capabilities mapping to the matching association models</strong> :</p>

<p><em>Source : Mapping of IO capabilities to key generation method<sup id="fnref:7:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote" rel="footnote">7</a></sup> (without OOB nor LE Legacy Pairing)</em></p>

<p>Assuming smartphones would advertise themselves either as <em>DisplayYesNo</em> or <em>KeyboardDisplay</em> (highlighted cells), the above matrix shows that we should prepare to connect using any association model.</p>

<p>Additionally, this table emphasizes that <strong>a device may enforce the <em>Just Works</em> model</strong> simply by advertising itself as <em>NoInputNoOutput</em>. Although this makes it easier for the Industry to build devices with limited or no interface, this is also a leverage for pirates to force our system into a lower security.</p>

<p>We have the possibility to deny any pairing with the <em>Just Works</em> workflow, but this may prevent some genuine devices to connect : we should rather enforce a validation step. The main difference between “Just Works + validation” and other workflows would be the use of a custom authentication mechanism instead of a six-digit number verification.</p>

<h3 id="putting-it-altogether-with-bluez">Putting it altogether with BlueZ</h3>

<p>Now that we know <em>what</em> we should do in our solution, let’s have an overiew of <em>how</em> to implement it.</p>

<p>Linux systems (which we will use for our Raspberry Pi) have a complex Bluetooth stack, but we will only need to focus on the following parts :</p>

<ul>
  <li>the <a href="http://www.bluez.org/">BlueZ</a> system daemon will handle core Bluetooth features</li>
  <li>modules will allow us to connect with specialized services : ALSA/PulseAudio in our case in order to receive and play sound from paired devices</li>
  <li>a registration <strong>agent</strong> will handle the pairing part as we like</li>
</ul>

<p>Having the Bluez daemon and the audio modules work together is only a matter of configuration (which is already not trivial).</p>

<p>However I could not find a bluetooth agent matching my use case : the default agent <a href="https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/352494/alternative-to-the-now-deprecated-rfcomm-binary-in-bluez#463502"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">bt-agent</code> has been deprecated</a> ; the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">bluetoothctl</code> command is not really scriptable ; the quite common <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">simple-agent</code> sample script does not implement the right features.</p>

<h4 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h4>

<p>Bluetooth does not provide a secure and automatic way to pair with headless devices out of the box.</p>

<p>The existence of several association models with complex selection rules make it easy to get it wrong.</p>

<p>We will use the <em>bluez</em> Linux stack to implement the basis of our solution and will need to create a custom agent to handle pairing in the exact way we want.</p>

<p><strong>Part 1 is over, let’s see how to set up the whole thing in part 2 : “Raspberry Pi as a Bluetooth A2DP receiver” (soon available).</strong></p>

My goal was to offer a user-friendly way for anyone in the same room to pair its Bluetooth smartphone with the Raspberry Pi and play music through it, while making sure the neighbors won’t be able to connect without approval. To output music, you can connect a Hi-Fi system to the Raspberry Pi using the Jack plug or an audio add-on card : this part depends on your setup. Allright, let’s dive into how Bluetooth works. This is a two-part article : How Bluetooth pairing works (this part) Raspberry Pi as a Bluetooth A2DP receiver (soon available) How Bluetooth pairing works Bluetooth is quite a complex thing. Really. I haven’t realized before I started this mini project. Beside its original goal to be a wireless replacement for cables, Bluetooth actually includes a myriad of features. In order to understand how we should connect to our Raspberry Pi (RPi), let’s focus on some core aspects of Bluetooth. Bluetooth security models Being tightly coupled with hardware, Bluetooth has evolved a lot since its beginnings, following industry’s technical enhancements over the years. This is why it has so many security models ; let’s try to understand how they compare. There are two distinct “families” of Bluetooth. The legacy, Basic Rate (BR) was the first and only protocol in the beginning. It was quickly complemented with EDR (Enhanced Data Rate) in Bluetooth 2.0, hence the name BR/EDR. Bluetooth 4.0 came with another, not backward-compatible protocol : Bluetooth Low Energy (abbreviated LE, or BLE). This new Bluetooth “family” requires less energy and fits smartphones and IoT better. Althought BR/EDR and BLE are not compatible, Bluetooth devices can implement one or the other, or even both. For the record there is also an AMP specification, usually implemented in a secondary controller, in order to achieve Wi-Fi class transfer rates. Each protocol “family” has their own security and association models, even though they follow the same logic : Which security level to choose ? The Bluetooth Core Specification1 makes it clear that : Secure Connections Only Mode is sometimes called a “FIPS Mode”. This mode should be used when it is more important for a device to have high security than it is for it to maintain backwards compatibility with devices that do not support Secure Connections. My feeling reading the specifications is that Bluetooth was not made with high expectations on security from the beginning. It has so many trade-offs at the benefit of usability that Secure Connections, whether for BR/EDR or LE, just looks to me like the bare minimum to have. BR/EDR Legacy Pairing’s security for instance unavoidably depends on the length of the PIN (which is often a small four-digit number, or even a fixed value) and provide little-to-none protection against eavesdropping or man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks. Secure Simple Pairing for its part only “protects the user from MITM attacks with a goal of offering a 1 in 1,000,000 chance that a MITM could mount a successful attack2“. It strongly depends on human decisions (based on failure alerts in case of an attack) to mitigate the risk and allows for configurations that would make it unsecure. Without going on with further examples, it’s easy to configure it wrong and let the neighbors accidentally connect to your Bluetooth device or any passing-by hacker to gather any personal information. Also, “LE is the new BR/EDR”. Most efforts seem to be put on Bluetooth LE and Bluetooh BR/EDR suffers from not being up-to-date with today’s requirements. For instance : in BR/EDR, cryptographic key generation is being made in lower, often hardware, layers, making it difficult to upgrade security algorithms. This is probably the fate of a very pragmatic specification that didn’t intend to foresee the future of technology ; unfortunately this leaves us with a plethora of unsecure devices in the wild. Wrapping up, this gives the “LE Secure Connections” mode my preference and I will try to make it rule my configuration. Bluetooth association models The above diagram states that there are several association models ; here are the four ones that apply to Bluetooth Low Energy : Numeric Comparison (only since Bluetooth 4.2 for BLE) Just Works Passkey entry Out-of-Band (OOB) For the sake of completeness we will also talk about : BR/EDR Legacy pairing Let’s see how they work, and how well they would fit our use case. Numeric comparison The Bluetooth Core Specification3 has a very neat way to describe the Numeric Comparison model : The user is shown a six digit number (from “000000” to “999999”) on both displays and then asked whether the numbers are the same on both devices. If “yes” is entered on both devices, the pairing is successful. It is important to understand that this number is not chosen by any party : it is randomly computed on each connection attempt, as part of the pairing algorithm4. It is not a passcode either : it just helps users check that they pair to the expected device by showing the same value on both sides. If a malicious user were trying to penetrate our home he would just have to hit “Yes” on its side, whatever the value of this 6-digit number. The Numeric Comparison protocol also allows devices to skip this user confirmation4 to automatically pair, but in order to preserve control over who can connect, we should not make this possible and enforce a confirmation on the RPi side. Just works The Just Works model is a specific case of Numeric Comparison designed for the case where at least one device in the pair has no human interface at all. Therefore, it does not enforce any confirmation whatsoever. Here is an excerpt from the specifications3 : The Just Works association model uses the Numeric Comparison protocol but the user is never shown a number and the application may simply ask the user to accept the connection (exact implementation is up to the end product manufacturer). As for Numeric Comparison, it looks like a good candidate for our use case, provided that we add a confirmation step as allowed. Passkey Entry Passkey Entry is used when one of the devices has input capabilities but no display (e.g. a keyboard). A six-digit number is displayed on the device that can display and must be entered on the other one for the pairing to be successful. At the difference of Numeric Comparison, this number is not only here to check that the devices are the ones we intend to pair, but it also serves as an input data required to authenticate and validate the association4 5. In contrast with Numeric Comparison, this model does not allow automatic connection because each side has to prove they know the passkey : the display device is the only one to know the number in the beginning ; it decides the way the passkey is revealed to the other one the input-only device must enter the (supposedly secret) passkey With some tweaks, a headless Raspberry Pi might be on one side or the other : if it were the display device, we should replace the display step with an equivalent, headless mechanism that allows the other user to obtain the number if it were the input-only device, we should find a way to get the number displayed on the other device entered into the RPi This may not look trivial ; we’ll see what can be done later on… Out of Band (OOB) With Out of Band, the devices first discover (and optionally authenticate) themselves with a different mechanism than Bluetooth. It can be any protocol, like NFC or Wi-Fi for instance. This fits well when both devices are known to share a common mechanism and are explicitly set up to work in this way. For instance a camera and its manufacturer’s mobile application will both be programmed to connect with NFC first, then share their “services” through Bluetooth. But this seemingly won’t work for us, as we want to allow common smartphones - with only standard applications - to connect. Furthermore, adding another mechanism than Bluetooth as a requirement looks superfluous… BR/EDR models The four previous models also apply to the BR/EDR side but with some subtle differences in their implementation, which we will not cover… Finally, there is one more model that apply only to the BR/EDR family : BR/EDR Legacy pairing, which was the only association model before Bluetooth 2.1 (see the diagram above). It requires the two devices to enter the same, 16-character maximum, secret PIN code. Although it looks similar to Passkey Entry, it is far less secure because, here, the connection’s encryption directly depends on the complexity of the PIN code. What sounds like a practical idea that could be easily implemented on headless devices by simply setting up a static PIN code, unfortunately reveals to be largely unsecure, because the underlying cryptography is not strong enough to compensate weak/short/static/numeric only PIN codes that can be seen on many devices in the wild… It is therefore not considered a potential solution in this article. TODO Compare the security of a four-digit vs a really long PIN code in this model vs in other models Choosing the right association model I’ve chosen the three following factors to compare BLE association models regarding my use case : Should not require complex user interaction on the Raspberry Pi’s side (e.g. no SSH login to type a passkey) Must be able to control who can connect to the Raspberry Pi (i.e. only known device or manually approved ones) Secure enough (as much as Bluetooth can) Let’s summarize what we’ve asserted in the previous chapter :   Numeric comparison* Just Works Passkey Entry Out of Band BR/EDR Legacy Pairing No user interaction no ❌ yes ✅ no ❌ assumed yes ✅ yes ✅ Control who can connect no ❌ no ❌ yes ✅ assumed yes ✅ yes ✅ Secure yes ✅ yes ✅ yes ✅ yes** ✅ no ❌ * without automatic pairing ** even more than others6 This table shows, in a way, that authorization in Bluetooth expects either no approval or a manual one, which makes it hard to get good security with headless devices… As discussed before, Out of Band is eliminated because it requires another protocol and BR/EDR Legacy Pairing is irrelevant for security reasons. In order to get all three requirements met we therefore may use : Just Works with additional authorization Numeric Comparison with a headless validation step Passkey Entry with a headless mechanism to display and validate a 6-digit number Unfortunately, except for BR/EDR Legacy Pairing one cannot choose the association model : it is asserted from the devices’ capabilities, called Input and Output capabilities (IO capabilities)7. In order to make sure only approved workflows can be selected, our RPi device must therefore advertise only the matching IO capabilites. How ? There are full-blown tables3 describing the available IO capabilities and the mapping to the matching association models. The input capabilites are : No input : Device does not have the ability to indicate ‘yes’ or ‘no’ Yes / No : Device provides the user a way to indicate either ‘yes’ or ‘no’ Keyboard : Device allows the user to input numbers and to indicate ‘yes’ or ‘no’ And the output capabilities are : No output : Device does not have the ability to display or communicate a 6 digit decimal number Numeric output : Device has the ability to display or communicate a 6 digit decimal number Here is an overview of the IO capabilities mapping to the matching association models : Mapping of IO capabilities to key generation method (simplified) Device A (Initiator) Display Only (No input + Numeric output) Display YesNo (Yes/No + Numeric output) Keyboard Only (Keyboard + No output) NoInput NoOutput (No input or Yes/No + No output) Keyboard Display (Keyboard + Numeric output) Device B (Responder) Display Only Just Works Just Works Passkey Entry : responder displays, initiator inputs Just Works Passkey Entry : responder displays, initiator inputs Display YesNo Just Works Numeric Comparison Passkey Entry : responder displays, initiator inputs Just Works Numeric Comparison Keyboard Only Passkey Entry: initiator displays, responder inputs Passkey Entry: initiator displays, responder inputs Passkey Entry: both input Just Works Passkey Entry: initiator displays, responder inputs NoInput NoOutput Just Works Just Works Just Works Just Works Just Works Keyboard Display Passkey Entry: initiator displays, responder inputs Numeric Comparison Passkey Entry: responder displays, initiator inputs Just Works Numeric Comparison Source : Mapping of IO capabilities to key generation method7 (without OOB nor LE Legacy Pairing) Assuming smartphones would advertise themselves either as DisplayYesNo or KeyboardDisplay (highlighted cells), the above matrix shows that we should prepare to connect using any association model. Additionally, this table emphasizes that a device may enforce the Just Works model simply by advertising itself as NoInputNoOutput. Although this makes it easier for the Industry to build devices with limited or no interface, this is also a leverage for pirates to force our system into a lower security. We have the possibility to deny any pairing with the Just Works workflow, but this may prevent some genuine devices to connect : we should rather enforce a validation step. The main difference between “Just Works + validation” and other workflows would be the use of a custom authentication mechanism instead of a six-digit number verification. Putting it altogether with BlueZ Now that we know what we should do in our solution, let’s have an overiew of how to implement it. Linux systems (which we will use for our Raspberry Pi) have a complex Bluetooth stack, but we will only need to focus on the following parts : the BlueZ system daemon will handle core Bluetooth features modules will allow us to connect with specialized services : ALSA/PulseAudio in our case in order to receive and play sound from paired devices a registration agent will handle the pairing part as we like Having the Bluez daemon and the audio modules work together is only a matter of configuration (which is already not trivial). However I could not find a bluetooth agent matching my use case : the default agent bt-agent has been deprecated ; the bluetoothctl command is not really scriptable ; the quite common simple-agent sample script does not implement the right features. Conclusion Bluetooth does not provide a secure and automatic way to pair with headless devices out of the box. The existence of several association models with complex selection rules make it easy to get it wrong. We will use the bluez Linux stack to implement the basis of our solution and will need to create a custom agent to handle pairing in the exact way we want. Part 1 is over, let’s see how to set up the whole thing in part 2 : “Raspberry Pi as a Bluetooth A2DP receiver” (soon available).

<p>As I feared when I <a href="/2016/Migrating-from-Drupal-to-Jekyll">migrated to GitHub’s hosting</a>, it has become too complicated to overcome GitHub’s limitations on Jekyll plugins and features.</p>

<p>I just needed to create a <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/docs/collections/"><em>collection</em></a> to put my <a href="/2016/Migrating-from-Drupal-to-Jekyll">“live drafts”</a> into it, but the deprecated <em>jekyll-paginate</em> plugin provided with GitHub pages didn’t support collections.</p>

<p>I therefore switched to offline-building my site and pushing the generated static files to GitHub, which now serves them without Jekyll processing. I still use Jekyll to generate the final static files, which is perfectly ok.
The only thing I’m missing a bit is automatic build &amp; deploy after a minor edit from my android smartphone (using <a href="https://f-droid.org/fr/packages/net.gsantner.markor/">Markor</a> to edit and <a href="https://f-droid.org/fr/packages/com.manichord.mgit/">MGit</a> to push to GitHub). It might be solved with some Travis CI automation I guess…</p>

<p><a href="https://help.github.com/en/github/working-with-github-pages/about-github-pages#static-site-generators">GitHub’s documentation about this</a> is not very clear on the way one can still use <em>an autonomous</em> Jekyll installation to build offline, without them building the site with <strong>their</strong> locked-down Jekyll pipeline.
I assumed that I had to consider the procedure that applied to other tools. I had to :</p>

<ul>
  <li>create a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.nojekyll</code> file in the root of the repo</li>
  <li>change <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/docs/configuration/options/">Jekyll’s output directory</a> from <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">_site</code> to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">docs</code></li>
  <li>use the standard Jekyll dependencies in my <em>Gemfile</em> and specify the full <a href="https://github.com/github/pages-gem/blob/master/lib/github-pages/plugins.rb">list of plugins previously overwritten by github-pages</a> in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Gemfile</code> &amp; <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">_config.yml</code></li>
  <li>import and commit the code for the submodule <em>mastodon-timeline-widget</em> inside this repo, not only leaving the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.gitmodules</code> file (static Javascript files that are used in the site, which were pulled automatically during GitHub’s processing)</li>
  <li>make sure a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">docs/CNAME</code> text file containing the domain to serve is present after each build (I discovered <a href="https://github.com/mkdocs/mkdocs/pull/1497/commits">it is created when the custom domain is enabled on GitHub</a> ; unfortunately it is in the output <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">docs/</code> directory, which may legitimately be deleted with a simple <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">jekyll clean</code>)</li>
  <li>I also had to change the name of the repo from <em>nicolabs.github.io</em> to <em>nicolabs.net</em> so it is not recognized as a user/organization repo, which was preventing me to put the code in a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">docs</code> subdirectory (I already had an <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">index.html</code> which had to be processed by Jekyll in the repo’s root, and therefore the website’s root could not be placed here)</li>
</ul>

<p>Overall it was very easy and quick to migrate !</p>]]></content><author><name>nicobo</name></author><category term="blogging" /><category term="jekyll" /><category term="github" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Jekyll logo - CC-BY-4.0 License - https://github.com/jekyll/brand As I feared when I migrated to GitHub’s hosting, it has become too complicated to overcome GitHub’s limitations on Jekyll plugins and features.

<h2 id="sweet-home-3d">Sweet Home 3D</h2>

<p><img src="https://www.sweethome3d.com/images/SweetHome3DLogo.png" alt="Sweet Home 3D logo" /></p>

<blockquote>
  <p><a href="https://www.sweethome3d.com">Sweet Home 3D</a> is a free interior design application which helps you draw the plan of your house, arrange furniture on it and visit the results in 3D.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And it works. I’ve been using it for years and I can still open the models, edit them… This is the exact reason why to choose open source here. No compatibility issue, works on Windows, Mac, Linux.</p>

<h2 id="nextcloud">NextCloud</h2>

<p><img src="/assets/blog/3rdparty/logos/nextcloud.108x72.png" alt="NextCloud logo" /></p>

<p><a href="https://nextcloud.com/">NextCloud</a> (a fork of <a href="https://owncloud.org/">OwnCloud</a>) is a very promising software that aims to bring usual cloud services to the home.</p>

<p>However, it’s based on pluggable features that are not always stable. Here are the ones I’m using on a day-to-day basis :</p>

<ul>
  <li>web interface to <strong>access my own files</strong> (however synchronization, backup and other features on files are not yet usable in my opinion)</li>
  <li><strong>share files</strong> with others</li>
  <li><strong>calendar</strong> (coupled with DAVDroid and any Android calendar it has all features Google Calendar has, except event import from/sharing to email)</li>
  <li><strong>contacts</strong> (really excellent)</li>
  <li><strong>news</strong> (use with a RSS/Atom reader on your mobile)</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="plantuml">PlantUML</h2>

<p><img src="/assets/blog/3rdparty/logos/plantuml.116x112.png" alt="PlantUML logo" /></p>

<p><a href="https://plantuml.com/">PlantUML</a> is a very simple <strong>textual language to create diagrams</strong>.
You describe your diagram as plain text and use any of the provided tool to automatically render a picture.</p>

<p>It is very easy to learn and has integrations with <a href="https://plantuml.com/fr/running">A LOT</a> of tools.
As the diagrams are simple text blocks, you can save them in a version control system, diff’ them, embed them in other documents, copy/paste them in online tools to view and edit, …
It has several renderers out of the box like PNG, SVG, LaTeX ; you can even generate ASCII art sequence diagrams !</p>

<p>I use it at work in <em>maven</em> builds to generate technical or inline documentation, in <em>Atom</em> or <em>Visual Studio Code</em> for writing specifications, you can live-code architectures with colleagues, build deployment diagrams on the fly within a web page, …
You will also find several other tools not referenced from the main site but using the same language.</p>

<p>The main drawback is that you don’t control the way figures are laid out.
Even with the few tweaks available you may not be able to get a clear view with the biggest diagrams.</p>

<h2 id="twidere">Twidere</h2>

<p><img src="/assets/blog/3rdparty/logos/twidere.512x512.png" alt="Twidere logo" height="128px" /></p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/TwidereProject/Twidere-Android">Twidere</a> is definitely the only one, perfect, <strong>Twitter</strong> Android client for me (and I’ve been searching a lot).
It’s open source. It handles every single feature I need (disclaimer : I’m only a casual Twitter user).</p>

<p>I’ve been using it for years… And since it happens to be very good also at <strong>Mastodon</strong> I do continue to use it every day.</p>

<h2 id="wallabag">Wallabag</h2>

<p><img src="/assets/blog/3rdparty/logos/wallabag.200x69.png" alt="Wallabag logo" /></p>

<p><a href="https://wallabag.org">Wallabag</a> is an open source alternative to <em>Pocket</em>, <em>Instapaper</em>, … to save articles from the web and <strong>read them later</strong>.
There are integrations with web browsers and smartphones.
I’ve been adding and reading articles with wallabag for years : you don’t need another tool !</p>

<h2 id="more-tools">More tools</h2>

<p>The following ones are part of my toolbox, they will get a small description each in the future :</p>

<ul>
  <li>Passwordstore
    <ul>
      <li>warning ! <a href="https://github.com/android-password-store/Android-Password-Store/issues/648">The f-droid version is far out of date</a>. It’s kind of tough to get a seamless integration with all tools (e.g. you have to get the very latest Android to benefit from Firefox mobile integration) but the simplicity of the mechanism (it’s nothing else than GPG-encrypted files possibly versioned with git) make it universal. I’m only doubtful about the community looking smaller than the one of the more graphical KeePass, which is a risk to see it unsupported in the future.</li>
      <li>it can use git to pull &amp; push changes to remote devices (the safest and most portable way I’ve found : it works in all clients I’ve tested : qtpass, Android, iOS), but not all apps provide the same user experience (e.g. <em>passforios</em> does not pull/push automatically, it’s just a button but still annoying). The best option here - because we talk about critical data like passwords - is to use a private git repository, which unfortunately requires setting up a server</li>
      <li>or you can use SyncThing for a seamless synchronization, with its (see below)</li>
      <li>Available apps are not official and therefore suffer from a different maturity ; e.g. <em>passforios</em> cannot generate SSH nor PGP keys by itself : it must import them (and <a href="https://pgpro.app/">PGPro</a> only works on iOS 13+)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>SyncThing is a very useful and generic decentralized (server-less) synchronization system for all your devices. However I couldn’t install it on iPhone and you can’t go without conflict files on a regular basis (which are just ok to delete 99% of the time however, so it’s fine in the end because it could not be done better after thinking about it)</li>
  <li>ForceDoze (Android)</li>
  <li>K-9 Mail</li>
  <li>Silence</li>
  <li>VLC</li>
  <li>Markor (Android) / Bear (iOS)</li>
  <li>FastHub-Libre</li>
  <li>RadioDroid</li>
  <li>AntennaPod</li>

Sweet Home 3D Sweet Home 3D is a free interior design application which helps you draw the plan of your house, arrange furniture on it and visit the results in 3D. And it works. I’ve been using it for years and I can still open the models, edit them… This is the exact reason why to choose open source here. No compatibility issue, works on Windows, Mac, Linux. NextCloud NextCloud (a fork of OwnCloud) is a very promising software that aims to bring usual cloud services to the home. However, it’s based on pluggable features that are not always stable. Here are the ones I’m using on a day-to-day basis : web interface to access my own files (however synchronization, backup and other features on files are not yet usable in my opinion) share files with others calendar (coupled with DAVDroid and any Android calendar it has all features Google Calendar has, except event import from/sharing to email) contacts (really excellent) news (use with a RSS/Atom reader on your mobile) PlantUML PlantUML is a very simple textual language to create diagrams. You describe your diagram as plain text and use any of the provided tool to automatically render a picture. It is very easy to learn and has integrations with A LOT of tools. As the diagrams are simple text blocks, you can save them in a version control system, diff’ them, embed them in other documents, copy/paste them in online tools to view and edit, … It has several renderers out of the box like PNG, SVG, LaTeX ; you can even generate ASCII art sequence diagrams ! I use it at work in maven builds to generate technical or inline documentation, in Atom or Visual Studio Code for writing specifications, you can live-code architectures with colleagues, build deployment diagrams on the fly within a web page, … You will also find several other tools not referenced from the main site but using the same language. The main drawback is that you don’t control the way figures are laid out. Even with the few tweaks available you may not be able to get a clear view with the biggest diagrams. Twidere Twidere is definitely the only one, perfect, Twitter Android client for me (and I’ve been searching a lot). It’s open source. It handles every single feature I need (disclaimer : I’m only a casual Twitter user). I’ve been using it for years… And since it happens to be very good also at Mastodon I do continue to use it every day. Wallabag Wallabag is an open source alternative to Pocket, Instapaper, … to save articles from the web and read them later. There are integrations with web browsers and smartphones. I’ve been adding and reading articles with wallabag for years : you don’t need another tool ! More tools The following ones are part of my toolbox, they will get a small description each in the future : Passwordstore warning ! The f-droid version is far out of date. It’s kind of tough to get a seamless integration with all tools (e.g. you have to get the very latest Android to benefit from Firefox mobile integration) but the simplicity of the mechanism (it’s nothing else than GPG-encrypted files possibly versioned with git) make it universal. I’m only doubtful about the community looking smaller than the one of the more graphical KeePass, which is a risk to see it unsupported in the future. it can use git to pull &amp; push changes to remote devices (the safest and most portable way I’ve found : it works in all clients I’ve tested : qtpass, Android, iOS), but not all apps provide the same user experience (e.g. passforios does not pull/push automatically, it’s just a button but still annoying). The best option here - because we talk about critical data like passwords - is to use a private git repository, which unfortunately requires setting up a server or you can use SyncThing for a seamless synchronization, with its (see below) Available apps are not official and therefore suffer from a different maturity ; e.g. passforios cannot generate SSH nor PGP keys by itself : it must import them (and PGPro only works on iOS 13+) SyncThing is a very useful and generic decentralized (server-less) synchronization system for all your devices. However I couldn’t install it on iPhone and you can’t go without conflict files on a regular basis (which are just ok to delete 99% of the time however, so it’s fine in the end because it could not be done better after thinking about it) ForceDoze (Android) K-9 Mail Silence VLC Markor (Android) / Bear (iOS) FastHub-Libre RadioDroid AntennaPod F-Droid]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Migrating from Drupal to Jekyll</title><link href="https://www.nicolabs.net/2016/Migrating-from-Drupal-to-Jekyll" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Migrating from Drupal to Jekyll" /><published>2016-11-13T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2020-04-13T00:00:00+02:00</updated><id>https://www.nicolabs.net/2016/Migrating-from-Drupal-to-Jekyll</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://www.nicolabs.net/2016/Migrating-from-Drupal-to-Jekyll"><![CDATA[<p><img src="/assets/blog/nicobo-landscape.png" alt="Previous blog's banner background" /></p>

<h2 id="new-blog-concept-">New blog concept ?</h2>

<p>I write articles about things that required enough amount of work for them to be considered worth sharing.
Writing, in turn, also require a fair amount of work to be comprehensive and accurate enough.</p>

<p>I have to admit however that I don’t have time to write advanced articles as much as I would like to.
Many of them just stay unfinished in a draft state, never published…</p>

<p>Therefore this blog is going to show shorter (and some unfinished) articles !
The good news is that some content that was hidden, in draft state, is going to be live !</p>

<p>A first approach was to simply use a <em>git</em> branch to put drafts (usually named ‘develop’), then merge them into the ‘master’ branch ; but that would imply either to publish two blogs : ‘draft’ and ‘release’ or to create a mechanism to merge the two branches into the same blog.</p>

<p>I finally opted for a label in each article indicating its <em>maturity level</em> :</p>

<ul>
  <li><span class="post-header"><span class="post-meta"><span class="maturity-label maturity-draft">draft</span></span></span> A <em>draft</em> label means something like “This article is in the process of being written, take it carefully as it may be wrong or change tomorrow”. <strong>I don’t endorse</strong> the content of such articles even if published, however one may find its content useful in some way…</li>
  <li><span class="post-header"><span class="post-meta"><span class="maturity-label maturity-good">good</span></span></span> An article with a <em>good</em> maturity is one that I consider ready for publication, even if it has some minor flaws or missing parts.</li>
  <li><span class="post-header"><span class="post-meta"><span class="maturity-label maturity-stable">stable</span></span></span> <em>Stable</em> articles are the ones that have been published for a long time or that I consider rock-solid.</li>
  <li><span class="post-header"><span class="post-meta"><span class="maturity-label maturity-deprecated">deprecated</span></span></span> Some articles may explicitly be labeled as <em>deprecated</em> in order to emphasize the fact that they have deprecated content and should only be considered by people living in the past. Deprecation might not be a concept that suits perfectly within a maturity life cycle like previous labels, but for now I prefer keeping things simple and not using another tagging system.</li>
</ul>

<p>Please note that some articles may show a <em>stable</em> maturity while talking about <em>deprecated</em> things. This is because an article may still be relevant even when talking about supplanted technologies, and also because I’m not going to constantly review old articles to check if they’re still at the cutting edge… <a href="/articles/scaffolding-web-20">Scaffolding the Web 2.0</a> is a very good example of that case.</p>

<p>In order to get an idea of the freshness of an article, I therefore print both its <em>creation</em> and <em>last update</em> times, allowing people to judge by themselves if it’s likely to be up-to-date or not.</p>

<p>The paradigm I was fond of is therefore changing : a permanent URL on this blog still leads to the same article, but its content can definitely change (and break referring sources). In order to reference a content at a given fixed time, one can link to the original content on GitHub : there is a link to the full history of each article over their creation and update times labels (try with this one).</p>

<p>Lastly, I still use the <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/docs/drafts/">drafts feature of Jekyll</a> to prevent publishing of <em>very</em> early notes that are just ideas or not even readable… Those can still be viewed in GitHub sources, but are not publicly rendered (I have a special <span class="post-header"><span class="post-meta"><span class="maturity-label maturity-unpublished">unpublished</span></span></span> label for myself).</p>

<h2 id="migrating-paths">Migrating paths</h2>

<p>Beside changing the concept, I’m also changing the platform, moving from self-hosted Drupal to Jekyll on GitHub Pages.</p>

<p>During this migration I’ve tried to keep the old URLs still valid by keeping a way to make it through <em>HTTP redirects</em>. Mostly for fun.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Assets (images) are moved to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/assets/blog/...</code> and specified as is in the markdown sources. I could have used Jekyll’s features to insert some variable but I did not want to add too much non-markdown (and framework-specific) code in the articles’ source. If the assets were to move again, it should be quite easy to replace all <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/assets/blog/...</code> strings with the correct path.</li>
  <li>I’ve used Jekyll’s <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">permalink</code> option to keep the short URL of the articles so I just have to add an <em>HTTP redirect</em> to serve the new blog under the old URLs.</li>
</ul>

<p>There is a screenshot of what the previous blog at <a href="http://nicobo.net">nicobo.net</a> was looking like : <a href="/assets/blog/screenshots/nicobo.net-screenshot-2019-10-26%2020-00-21.png">screenshot</a>.</p>

<h2 id="whats-lost">What’s lost</h2>

<p>From rich HTML to Markdown, I’ve lost some of the visual/semantic styles I was using : I had to merge or get rid of some of them.</p>

<p>Actually I must say that this does not really look like a bad thing : they were not <em>critical</em> to the meaning of the text and it’s easier to concentrate on the content itself.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Lack of underlining in Markdown : I’ve used <em>normal</em> (*) or <strong>strong</strong> (**) emphasis</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">file names</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">commands</code> used to have separate styles : although I miss this one a bit, I am now enclosing both of them in back ticks (`) and saving some seconds thinking about which style to use here.</li>
  <li>I used to have 2 types of block quotes : <em>notes</em> and <em>warnings</em>. I am now using markdown quotes (&gt;) for both, emphasizing important words for <em>warnings</em> types</li>
  <li>Pictures and text layout is now only a vertical flow : I don’t really care as it’s always been for pure visual left/right/center alignment and I used to spend a significant time building it.</li>
  <li>Most of the visual helps I used to render with CSS are now back as indications in the text. E.g. I could emphasize portions of code to make the reader focus on them ; now I just describe them right before/after the code</li>
  <li>I was using a <em>main tag</em> as a category : android, java, … Although <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/docs/posts/#categories-and-tags">jekyll supports categories</a>, I’m now using only one level of tags for the better : all tags are equals !</li>
  <li>No custom excerpt and picture to advertise an article in the front page (<a href="https://jekyllrb.com/docs/posts/#post-excerpts">Jekyll has this kind of feature</a> but <a href="https://github.com/nicolabs/nicolabs.net/issues/14">it’s not working out-of-the-box for me</a>, so for now there is a short excerpt automatically extracted from the first paragraph that lacks some serious markdown parsing)</li>
  <li>No integrated internationalization (<em>i18n</em>) but I have only few articles in french, all others are in English, and I feel it’s not going to be a lot of work to add this feature</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="what-i-like">What I like</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Simplicity : the default theme, the generation mechanism, the Markdown language, everything is turned towards simplicity, allowing to concentrate on content.</li>
  <li>This is really close to the ideal blogging platform I was looking for my ‘work in progress’ blog concept (i.e. even drafts are published and articles are always evolving)</li>
  <li>Integrates very well with Atom and its <em>git</em> &amp; <em>markdown preview</em> plugins</li>
  <li>Last but not least, it is a very portable platform, since it’s just offline generation of HTML files and upload. GitHub automates the build so I don’t really upload generated files but to go over some limitations they put on <em>GitHub Pages</em> I may simply change hosting and then really push offline-generated content. That’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle">KISS</a>. Also static site generation not limited to Jekyll, <a href="https://blog.jim-nielsen.com/2018/choosing-a-static-site-generator/">there are other</a> <a href="https://github.com/myles/awesome-static-generators#photography">very promising</a> engines, even distributed ones…</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="what-i-dont-like">What I don’t like</h2>

<ul>
  <li>On GitHub Pages there is <em>only one</em> theme, <em>only one</em> markdown engine : GitHub surely needs to rationalize services it provides but on my side I hope it will not lead to dead ends and migration to another host…</li>
  <li>No <em>autolink</em> feature for <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">kramdown</code>, the only supported markdown engine on GitHub Pages, which would have saved me from rewriting all links that had just their own URL as text. By the way I therefore rewrote the links’ text trimming the redundant “http://” or “www” parts, making the text more readable. For the record, I was able to do this with this single <em>regular expression</em> : <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">s/(https?:\/\/)(www\.)?([^\s$]+)/[$3]($1$2$3)/g</code></li>

<p>A year ago I was very excited to get my hands at <em>Sass</em>.</p>

<p>I thought it could fill the gaps in coding with CSS : preventing variables duplications, automatic generation of multiple static stylesheets depending on the rendering device (vs using media queries which are not always supported and require downloading all versions of the code)…</p>

<p>But it could not.</p>

<h2 id="what-really-is-saas">What really is Saas</h2>

<p><a href="http://sass-lang.com/">Sass-lang.com</a> states it is a “CSS extension language”, but don’t take it literaly or you will head straight for failure.</p>

<p>That would imply that Sass adds instructions to the CSS language ; however it’s not right because web browsers today only understand CSS, not Sass.</p>

<p>Sass is nothing but dynamic : it’s a pre-processor that may only really be used to offline-produce different versions of a CSS with different sizes, colors and layouts, but it’s not able to make your CSS dynamic. It’s just several static versions of CSS that you must still dynamically/selectively load using an external mechanism (like static media queries or Javascript).</p>

<p>I fell into this trap as I tried to organize stylesheets with inheritance like in <strong>o</strong>bject <strong>o</strong>riented languages (<em>OO</em>) : this structure would always failed at a given point.</p>

<p>For instance : as variables only live in the Sass context, and disappear in the compiled CSS, if you want to make two versions of a stylesheet with different values of the same variable, you only have one option : build a CSS block or stylesheet for each value. There is no added value using Sass variables in media queries because they will just be replaced with their static, final value.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>Make no mistake : Sass is a very helpful evolution for CSS, <strong>use it</strong>, but <strong>know its limits</strong> !</p>

<h2 id="-html5-boilerplate"><img src="/assets/blog/h5bp-logo.png" alt="H5BP logo (star)" class="inline" style="vertical-align:middle;" /> HTML5 Boilerplate</h2>

<p><strong>HTML5 Boilerplate</strong> (a.k.a. <em>H5BP</em>) is the original scaffolding tool by Paul Irish &amp; Co (will have to search for the exact history…).</p>

<p>It allows you to build a clean website structure with standard features based on best practices like :</p>

<ul>
  <li>responsive design-ready CSS</li>
  <li>standard javascript libraries : Modernizr, Respond.js, …</li>
  <li>404 page</li>
  <li>Google Analytics</li>
  <li>favicons for apple</li>
  <li>many more…</li>
</ul>

<p>It does not support CSS preprocessing (SASS, …) and requires you some effort to upgrade to the latest version later (by separating your work from the original files that will be upgraded)…</p>

<p>It’s good for <strong>small</strong> sites.</p>

<p>Find it at <a href="http://html5boilerplate.com">html5boilerplate.com</a></p>

<h2 id="-initializr"><img src="/assets/blog/html5-logo-165.png" alt="Initializr logo" class="inline" style="vertical-align:middle;" height="80px" /> Initializr</h2>

<p>While <em>H5BP</em> is a static project template to download, <strong>Initializr</strong> allows you to customize it by selecting the features you want on your site and then downloading the generated files.</p>

<p>It has 3 ready-to-use configurations :</p>

<ul>
  <li>Classic H5BP</li>
  <li>Responsive (using a custom framework by <a href="https://github.com/verekia">@verekia</a>)</li>
  <li>(Twitter) Bootstrap</li>
</ul>

<p>The customization is made online and on-the-fly : you can see the generated files directly online while filtering the features (“What’s inside” button).
It still does not support CSS preprocessing.</p>

<p>Since it’s simply a “configurator” over H5BP I find it <strong>more convenient</strong> than H5BP alone <strong>for small sites</strong>.</p>

<p>Find it at <a href="http://www.initializr.com">initializr.com</a></p>

<h2 id="-yeoman"><img src="/assets/blog/yeoman-1.svg" alt="Yeoman logo" class="inline" style="vertical-align:middle;" height="80px" /> Yeoman</h2>

<p>To solve the “static template” issue, <em>H5BP</em> first evolved into “<a href="https://github.com/h5bp/generator-mobile-boilerplate">generator-mobile-boilerplate</a>”, then into several specialized tools now known as “<strong>Yeoman</strong>”.</p>

<p>Those tools bring the features you usually want on any project :</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>yo</strong> scaffolds your project (like a <em>Maven archetype</em>)</li>
  <li><strong>Grunt</strong> and <strong>Gulp</strong> build and execute it (like <em>Maven</em> / <em>Ant</em>)</li>
  <li><strong>Bower</strong> and <strong>npm</strong> handle dependencies (like <em>Maven</em> / <em>Ivy</em>)</li>
</ul>

<p>In short, Yeoman is the <strong>standard</strong>, complete tool suite for Web 2.0 developers like Maven is for Java developers.</p>
