(BR/EDR Legacy Pairing) as bredr_legacy_pairing
    note right of bredr_legacy_pairing
        Since the beginning

        Lowest security (based on SAFER+ algorithms)
        There is only **one pairing workflow**.
    end note
(Secure Simple Pairing) as secure_simple_pairing
    note right of secure_simple_pairing
        Since 2.1 + EDR

        Enhances security with stronger (FIPS) algorithms,
        passive eavesdropping & MITM protections,
        and **4 possible pairing workflows**.
        Some security is still at the level of <i>BR/EDR legacy</i>.
    end note
(BR/EDR Secure Connections) as bredr_legacy_secure_connections
    note right of bredr_legacy_secure_connections
        Since 4.1

        Fills the remaining security gaps.
    end note
(LE Legacy Pairing) as le_legacy_pairing
    note left of le_legacy_pairing
        Since 4.0

        Similar to BR/EDR's <i>Secure Simple Pairing</i>
        but with only **3 pairing workflows**
        (misses <i>Numeric Comparison</i>)
        and trades some security for usability.
    end note
(LE Secure Connections) as le_secure_connections
    note left of le_secure_connections
        Since 4.2

        Similar to <i>BR/EDR Secure Connections</i>,
        with the same **4 pairing workflows**.
    end note

bredr_legacy_pairing -up-> secure_simple_pairing
secure_simple_pairing -up-> bredr_legacy_secure_connections : Security upgrade through\n<i>Secure Connections</i>
