- needs federation of verification servers ( it's wip)
- same as keybase verification but with plain pgp
- does not include chat, files, git so one needs to use decentralized  tools  for that (and prove ownership of each account) : xmpp, GitLab instance,. ...
- in the end it's just the intended usage of pgp
- weakness is probably in fetching and parsing  proofs, which need a strict convention to prevent spoofing or tricking users into including fake claims in their online feeds
- also trust in proofs are intrinsically dependent on each social service security policy (e.g. if an admin can modify a post containing a claim, since they are not always signed)
- might include a 'twitter profile' fetcher that fetches claim from users profile instead of a tweet :
    - pros : doesn't pollute timeline, simpler to reverse, update
    - cons : profile has limited room for text
- can link/prove identities attached to several keys or is it only one key and multiple identities (star shaped) ?
