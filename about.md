This blog talks about computer technology.
The old version can still be viewed at [blog.nicolabs.net](http://blog.nicolabs.net) but will be deleted one day, since all new work is now made here.

You can find more work from me at [github.com/nicolabs](https://github.com/nicolabs) or [code.nicolabs.net](https://code.nicolabs.net).

## Making of

This site is built [with Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and published via [Github Pages](https://help.github.com/en/github/working-with-github-pages/about-github-pages-and-jekyll).

You can look at its source at [github.com/nicolabs/nicolabs.net](https://github.com/nicolabs/nicolabs.net) and the following articles talk about the site's construction : [Migrating from Drupal to Jekyll](/2016/Migrating-from-Drupal-to-Jekyll) and [Bypassing GitHub's Jekyll limitations](2020/Bypassing-GitHub-Jekyll-limitations).

Its theme is based on *nandomoreirame's* ["simplest" theme](https://github.com/nandomoreirame/simplest).

The code for estimating and displaying the time to read an article comes from [atekihcan.github.io](http://atekihcan.github.io/blog/2014/reading-time-estimate-in-jekyll) and [github.com/renyuanz/leonids](https://github.com/renyuanz/leonids).

The *mastodon* widget on the front page is from [mastodon-timeline-widget](https://github.com/nicolabs/mastodon-timeline-widget).

The [tags page](/tags) has been possible thanks to [this blog article](https://codinfox.github.io/dev/2015/03/06/use-tags-and-categories-in-your-jekyll-based-github-pages/).

[jekyll-plantuml](https://github.com/yegor256/jekyll-plantuml) is used to generate inline PlantUML diagrams. It has been [slightly modified](https://github.com/nicolabs/nicolabs.net/blob/master/_plugins/jekyll-plantuml.rb) to fit my needs.
